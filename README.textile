h1. This is the data for my homepage 

It is processed by "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll 
to create a static site.  This is done automatically when the
repo is pushed to github.  The results are currently located
"here":http://alopez.github.com.

This page is an attempt to create an *academic* webpage using
jekyll, including all of my publications and talks.  The basic
idea is for the papers and talks to show up as stories in a 
news feed.  The post items themselves act as a database which
is used to populate the main page.  I doubt anyone intended
for jekyll to be used this way, but it is flexible enough
and it seems to work.

I might also use it for blogging, but don't hold your breath.
