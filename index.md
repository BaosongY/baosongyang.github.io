I develop computational models of natural language learning, 
understanding and generation in people and machines, and my research 
focuses on basic scientific problems related to these models. I am 
especially interested in modeling the rich diversity of linguistic
phenomena across the worldâ€™s languages. 

I am a [Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reader_(academic_rank))
in the [Institute for Language, Cognition, and Computation](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc)
in the [School of Informatics](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/)
at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). 
[My research group](collaborators) is part of the larger 
[Edinburgh natural language processing group](http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/edinburghnlp/)
and we collaborate with many people in Edinburgh and more widely. I am 
also the co-director of the 
[Centre for Doctoral Training in Data Science](http://datascience.inf.ed.ac.uk/), 
which offers a four-year MSc + PhD programme.

## News

* In January 2019, [Sorcha Gilroy](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s1459276/) 
successfully defended her [PhD thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yi_dyiOKXbZdVNcGy789A26FE7nAoTn0/view?usp=sharing) on Probabilistic Graph Formalisms for
Meaning Representations. During her time as a student, she 
received an [oustanding paper award](https://naacl2018.wordpress.com/2018/04/11/outstanding-papers/)
at [NAACL 2018](http://naacl2018.org/) and was a finalist in University of Edinburgh 
[3-minute thesis competition](https://www.ed.ac.uk/institute-academic-development/postgraduate/doctoral/3mt/3mt-final),
along with many other accomplishments.

* Sorcha Gilroy and I gave a tutorial on 
[Graph Formalisms for Meaning Representations](https://bit.ly/GraphFormalismsEMNLP) at
[EMNLP 2018](http://emnlp2018.org/). We taught [a week-long course](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NtdhgieGKpnTvpYiBCUgkE-g0ygKDyE_) on 
the same topic at [NASSLLI 2018](https://www.cmu.edu/nasslli2018/).
