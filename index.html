<p>
I develop computational models of natural language learning, 
understanding and generation in people and machines, and my research 
focuses on basic scientific, mathematical, and engineering problems 
related to these models. I am especially interested in models 
that handle the diversity of morphological, syntactic, and semantic 
phenomena across the worldâ€™s languages. 
<a href="collaborators.html">My research group</a> is part of the larger 
<a href="http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/edinburghnlp/">Edinburgh natural language processing group</a>, 
and we collaborate with many people in Edinburgh and more widely. I am 
also the deputy director of the 
<a href="http://datascience.inf.ed.ac.uk/">Centre for Doctoral Training in Data
Science</a>, which offers a four-year MSc + PhD programme.

<h4>Current Highlights</h4>
<ul>
<li>
In June, my awesome PhD student <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s1459276/">Sorcha Gilroy</a> received an <a href="https://naacl2018.wordpress.com/2018/04/11/outstanding-papers/">outstanding
paper award</a> at <a href="http://naacl2018.org/">NAACL 2018</a> for a very cool
paper she coauthored on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05408">RNNs as weighted language recognizers</a>. 
In the same month, she was a finalist in University of Edinburgh <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/institute-academic-development/postgraduate/doctoral/3mt/3mt-final">3-minute thesis competition</a>.
</li>

<li>
Sorcha Gilroy and I 
taught a one-week course on "Graph formalisms for meaning 
representations" at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/nasslli2018/">NASSLLI 2018</a>.
We will give a half-day tutorial on the same topic at 
<a href="http://emnlp2018.org/">EMNLP 2018</a>.
