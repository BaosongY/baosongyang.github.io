abstract: >
  Hierarchical organization is a well known property of language, and
  yet the notion of hierarchical structure has been largely absent from
  the best performing machine translation systems in recent community-wide
  evaluations.  In this paper, we discuss a new hierarchical phrase-based
  statistical machine translation system (Chiang, 2005), presenting
  recent extensions to the original proposal, new evaluation results in
  a community-wide evaluation, and a novel technique for fine-grained
  comparative analysis of MT systems.
