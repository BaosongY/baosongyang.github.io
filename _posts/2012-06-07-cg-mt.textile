abstract: >
  Adding syntactic labels to synchronous context-free translation rules can
  improve performance, but labeling with phrase structure constituents, as in
  GHKM (Galley et al., 2004), excludes potentially useful translation rules. 
  SAMT (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006) introduces heuristics to create new
  non-constituent labels, but these heuristics introduce many complex labels and
  tend to add rarely-applicable rules to the translation grammar.        We
  introduce a new labeling scheme based on categorial grammar, which allows
  syntactic labeling of many rules with a minimal, well-motivated label set. We
  show that our labeling scheme performs comparably to SAMT on an Urduâ€“English
  translation task, yet the label set is an order of magnitude smaller, and
  translation is twice as fast.
