abstract: >
  We introduce improvements to statistical word 
  alignment based on the Hidden Markov 
  Model. One improvement incorporates syntactic 
  knowledge. Results on the workshop data 
  show that alignment performance exceeds that 
  of a state-of-the art system based on more complex 
  models, resulting in over a 5.5% absolute 
  reduction in error on Romanian-English.
