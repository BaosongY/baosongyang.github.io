title: How Does Machine Translation Work?
url: http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/alopez/talks/tt.pdf
venue: Guest lecture in Transformational Technologies class at the University of Maryland
note: >
  This is similar to the talks I gave at Colgate University and Union College.
  This talk is aimed at students outside of NLP who have no exposure to the 
  mechanics of machine translation. It's a fun talk, and I'd be happy to 
  present it at your university.
