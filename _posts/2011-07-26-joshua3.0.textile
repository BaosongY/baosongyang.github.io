abstract: >
  We present progress on Joshua, an open-source decoder for hierarchical and 
  syntax-based machine translation. The main focus is describing Thrax, a 
  ï¬‚exible, open source synchronous context-free grammar extractor. Thrax 
  extracts both hierarchical (Chiang, 2007) and syntax-augmented machine
  translation (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006) grammars. It is built on Apache 
  Hadoop for efficient distributed performance, and can easily be extended 
  with support for new grammars, feature functions, and output formats.
