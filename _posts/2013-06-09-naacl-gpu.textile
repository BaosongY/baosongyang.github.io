abstract: >
  Translation models can be scaled to large corpora and arbitrarily-long
  phrases by looking up translations of source phrases on the fly in
  an indexed parallel text. However, this is impractical because
  on-demand extraction of phrase tables is a major computational
  bottleneck. We solve this problem by developing novel algorithms for
  general purpose graphics processing units (GPUs), which enable suffix
  array queries for phrase lookup and phrase extractions to be massively
  parallelized. Our open-source implementation improves the speed of a
  highly-optimized, state-of-the-art serial CPU-based implementation by
  at least an order of magnitude. In a Chinese-English translation task, our
  GPU implementation extracts translation tables from
  approximately 100 million words of parallel text in less than 30
  milliseconds.
