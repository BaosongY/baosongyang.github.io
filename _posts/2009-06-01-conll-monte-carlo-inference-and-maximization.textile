abstract: >
  Recent advances in statistical machine translation have used beam search for 
  approximate NP-complete inference within probabilistic translation models.
  We present an alternative approach of sampling from the posterior distribution 
  defined by a translation model.  We define a novel Gibbs sampler for sampling 
  translations given a source sentence and show that it effectively explores this 
  posterior distribution.  In doing so we overcome the limitations of heuristic 
  beam search and obtain theoretically sound solutions to inference problems such 
  as finding the maximum probability translation and minimum expected risk training 
  and decoding.
