abstract: >
  We describe a method for identifying systematic patterns in translation 
  data using part-of-speech tag sequences. We incorporate this analysis 
  into a diagnostic tool intended for developers of machine translation 
  systems, and demonstrate how our application can be used by developers to 
  explore patterns in machine translation output.
