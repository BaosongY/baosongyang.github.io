  Parallel text is the fuel that drives modern
  machine translation systems. The Web is a
  comprehensive source of preexisting parallel text, but crawling the entire web is
  impossible for all but the largest companies. We bring web-scale parallel text to
  the masses by mining the Common Crawl,
  a public Web crawl hosted on Amazon’s
  Elastic Cloud. Starting from nothing more
  than a set of common two-letter language
  codes, our open-source extension of the
  STRAND algorithm mined 32 terabytes of
  the crawl in just under a day, at a cost of
  about $500. Our large-scale experiment
  uncovers large amounts of parallel text in
  dozens of language pairs across a variety
  of domains and genres, some previously
  unavailable in curated datasets. Even with
  minimal cleaning and ﬁltering, the resulting data boosts translation performance
  across the board for ﬁve different language
  pairs in the news domain, and on open domain test sets we see improvements of up
  to 5 BLEU. We make our code and data
  available for other researchers seeking to
  mine this rich new data resource.
