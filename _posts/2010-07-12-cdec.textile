abstract: >
  We present <tt>cdec</tt>, an open source framework for decoding, aligning with, and 
  training a number of statistical machine 
  translation models, including word-based 
  models, phrase-based models, and models 
  based on synchronous context-free grammars. Using a single uniﬁed internal 
  representation for translation forests, the 
  decoder strictly separates model-speciﬁc 
  translation logic from general rescoring, 
  pruning, and inference algorithms. From 
  this uniﬁed representation, the decoder can 
  extract not only the 1- or k-best translations, but also alignments to a reference, 
  or the quantities necessary to drive discriminative training using gradient-based 
  or gradient-free optimization techniques. 
  Its efficient C++ implementation means 
  that memory use and runtime performance 
  are signiﬁcantly better than comparable 
  decoders.
