abstract: >
  A major engineering challenge in
  statistical machine translation systems
  is the efficient representation of extremely large
  translation rulesets.
  In phrase-based models, this problem 
  can be addressed by storing the training data in memory and using a suffix
  array as an efficient index to quickly lookup and extract rules on the fly.
  <i>Hierarchical</i> phrase-based translation
  introduces the added wrinkle of source phrases with gaps.  
  Lookup algorithms used for contiguous phrases no longer apply and
  the best approximate pattern matching algorithms are much too slow,
  taking several minutes per sentence.
  We describe new lookup algorithms 
  for hierarchical phrase-based
  translation that reduce the empirical computation
  time by nearly two orders of magnitude, making on-the-fly
  lookup feasible for source phrases with gaps.
