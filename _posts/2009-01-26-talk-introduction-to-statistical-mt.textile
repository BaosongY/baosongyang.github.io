title: Introduction to Statistical Machine Translation
url: http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/alopez/talks/mtm-intro09.pdf
venue: Class lecture at the Third Machine Translation Marathon
note: >
  This is similar to the talks I gave at Maryland, Colgate, and Union.
  It's aimed a people with no prior knowledge of statistical translation,
  but hopefully fun for everyone.  I'd be happy to present for your class.
