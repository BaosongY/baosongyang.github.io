abstract: >
  State-of-the-art statistical machine translation is 
  based on alignments between <i>phrases</i>&mdash;sequences of words 
  in the source and target sentences.  The learning step in these 
  systems often relies on alignments between <i>words</i>.  
  It is often assumed that the quality of this word alignment is 
  critical for translation. However, recent results suggest that
  the relationship between alignment quality and translation quality
  is weaker than previously thought.  We investigate this 
  question directly, comparing the impact of high-quality 
  alignments with a carefully constructed set of degraded 
  alignments.  In order to tease apart various interactions, 
  we report experiments investigating the impact of alignments 
  on different aspects of the system.  Our results confirm a weak 
  correlation, but they also illustrate that more data and better 
  feature engineering may be more beneficial than better alignment.
