abstract: >
  We present a simple, one-pass word alignment algorithm for parallel text. Our algorithm utilizes synchronous parsing and takes advantage 
  of existing syntactic annotations. In our experiments the performance of this model is comparable to more complicated iterative methods. 
  We discuss the challenges and potential beneÔ¨Åts of using this model to train syntactic parsers for new languages.
