abstract: >
  Translation model size is growing at a pace that outstrips improvements in 
  computing power, and this hinders research on many interesting models.  We 
  show how an algorithmic scaling technique can be used to easily handle very 
  large models.  Using this technique, we explore several large model variants 
  and show an improvement 1.4 BLEU on the NIST 2006 Chinese-English task.  This 
  opens the door for work on a variety of models that are much less constrained 
  by computational limitations.
