abstract: > 
  Machine translation (MT) draws from several different disciplines, making 
  it a complex subject to teach. There are excellent pedagogical texts, but 
  problems in MT and current algorithms for solving them are best learned by 
  doing. As a centerpiece of our MT course, we devised a series of open-ended 
  challenges for students in which the goal was to improve performance on 
  carefully constrained instances of four key MT tasks: alignment, decoding, 
  evaluation, and reranking. Students brought a diverse set of techniques to 
  the problems, including some novel solutions which performed remarkably well. 
  A surprising and exciting outcome was that student solutions or their 
  combinations fared competitively on some tasks, demonstrating that even 
  newcomers to the field can help improve the state-of-the-art on hard NLP 
  problems while simultaneously learning a great deal. The problems, baseline 
  code, and results are freely available.
