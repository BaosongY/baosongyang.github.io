abstract: >
  Descriptions of statistical machine translation systems are littered with 
  confusing accounts of different algorithms for computing different 
  quantities under different models.  We present a unified view of many 
  translation algorithms that synthesizes work on deductive parsing, semiring 
  parsing, and efficient approximate search algorithms.  This gives rise to 
  clean methods of analysis and compact descriptions that can serve as the 
  basis for modular implementations.  Although the framework is drawn from 
  parsing and applied to translation, it is applicable to many dynamic
  programming problems arising in natural language processing and other areas.
