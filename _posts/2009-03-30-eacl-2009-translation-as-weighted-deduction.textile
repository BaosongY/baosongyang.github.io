abstract: >
  We present a unified view of many translation algorithms that synthesizes 
  work on deductive parsing, semiring parsing, and efficient approximate search 
  algorithms.  This gives rise to clean analyses and compact descriptions that 
  can serve as the basis for modular implementations.  We illustrate this with 
  several examples, showing how to mechanically develop search spaces using 
  non-local features, novel models, and a variety of disparate phrase-based 
  strategies.  Although the framework is drawn from parsing and applied to 
  translation, it is applicable to many dynamic programming problems arising 
  in natural language processing and other areas.
