abstract: >
  We present a unified view of many translation algorithms that synthesizes 
  work on deductive parsing, semiring parsing, and efficient approximate search 
  algorithms.  This gives rise to clean analyses and compact descriptions that 
  can serve as the basis for modular implementations.  We illustrate this with 
  several examples, showing how to mechanically develop search spaces using 
  non-local features, novel models, and a variety of disparate phrase-based 
  strategies.  Although the framework is drawn from parsing and applied to 
  translation, it is applicable to many dynamic programming problems arising 
  in natural language processing and other areas.
errata: >
  This draft corrects errors that appeared in the goal item of logic
  Monotone-Generate (Section 5; in particular, the goal item should have 
  no words left to generate); and the deductive rules of 
  Monotone-Generate + Ngram (Figure 2.2; the indexes of the n-gram context
  were incorrect, and the consequent of the second rule should start with
  i rather than i+1).
  <p>Thanks to Shay Cohen for pointing these out.
