      Character language models have access to surface morphological 
      patterns, but it is not clear whether or <i>how</i> they learn 
      abstract morphological regularities. We instrument a character 
      language model with several probes, finding that it can develop a 
      specific unit to identify word boundaries and, by extension, morpheme 
      boundaries, which allows it to capture linguistic properties and 
      regularities of these units. Our language model proves surprisingly 
      good at identifying the selectional restrictions of English 
      derivational morphemes, a task that requires both morphological and 
      syntactic awareness. Thus we conclude that, when morphemes overlap 
      extensively with the words of a language, a character language model 
      can perform morphological abstraction.

    title: "Towards Bidirectional Hierarchical Representations for Attention-Based Neural Machine Translation."

      This paper proposes a hierarchical attentional neural translation model which
      focuses on enhancing source-side hierarchical representations by covering both
      local and global semantic information using a bidirectional tree-based encoder.
      To maximize the predictive likelihood of target words, a weighted variant of an
      attention mechanism is used to balance the attentive information between lexical
      and phrase vectors. Using a tree-based rare word encoding, the proposed model is
      extended to sub-word level to alleviate the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem.
      Empirical results reveal that the proposed model significantly outperforms sequence-
      to-sequence attention-based and tree-based neural translation models in English-
      Chinese translation tasks.
