    abstract: >
      Character language models have access to surface morphological 
      patterns, but it is not clear whether or <i>how</i> they learn 
      abstract morphological regularities. We instrument a character 
      language model with several probes, finding that it can develop a 
      specific unit to identify word boundaries and, by extension, morpheme 
      boundaries, which allows it to capture linguistic properties and 
      regularities of these units. Our language model proves surprisingly 
      good at identifying the selectional restrictions of English 
      derivational morphemes, a task that requires both morphological and 
      syntactic awareness. Thus we conclude that, when morphemes overlap 
      extensively with the words of a language, a character language model 
      can perform morphological abstraction.
