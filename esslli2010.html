Machine translation is the automatic translation of human languages, such as English and Chinese.  Statistical machine translation refers to a collection of techniques in which machine translation systems automatically learn how to translate by examining a large corpus of human translations.  Statistical learning methods make it possible to build a translation system for a new language pair very quickly, even without deep knowledge of both languages.  These techniques are popular: most research papers on machine translation presented in <a href="http://aclweb.org/anthology-new/">major natural language processing conferences</a> focus on statistical methods.  They are also effective: <a href="http://translate.google.com">Google translate</a> is able to offer translation for thousands of language pairs due to the use of statistical methods.

<p>This course will provide a thorough introduction to statistical machine translation.  We will describe all aspects of building a statistical machine translation system, from both formal and practical perspectives.  Topics include translation modeling, rule induction and parameter learning, search algorithms, engineering techniques, and evaluation of systems.  Within each of these areas we will cover a variety of alternatives, from the mainstream to the novel, explaining current state of the art and identifying the open questions that are the topic of current research.


<h2>Lectures</h2>
My philosophy is that slides are visual aids for lectures, so the following
slides are best understood along with the accompanying talk.   While I don't
know of any recordings of the ESSLLI lectures, there is a 
<a href="http://webcast.jhu.edu/mediasite/Viewer/?peid=b2c753de8786426eb16a8372fcce83c1">video</a>
of a shorter, one-day 
<a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/alopez/talks/CLSP-introMT-2010.pdf">tutorial</a>
that I have given many times on this material.  Feel free to 
use any of this material as you  like.  I'd appreciate an acknowledgement if you do!

Introductory material on machine translation:
	<li><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/alopez/papers/survey.pdf">Statistical Machine Translation</a> by <a href="index.html">Adam Lopez</a>. This is a forty-page self-contained survey of the field of statistical machine translation that was published in ACM Computing Surveys.  Much of the course material is based on the survey, and you can find more formal explanations of many of the course concepts there.</li>
	<li>For even more detail, <a href="http://www.statmt.org/book/">Statistical Machine Translation</a> is an introductory textbook written by <a href="http://www.iccs.informatics.ed.ac.uk/~pkoehn/">Philipp Koehn</a>.  Anyone with a serious interest in machine translation should have a copy of it.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.isi.edu/natural-language/mt/wkbk.pdf">A Statistical MT Tutorial Workbook</a> by <a href="http://www.isi.edu/~knight/">Kevin Knight</a> is a great, informal introduction for beginners.  You might consider working through this exercise before moving on to the above texts.
