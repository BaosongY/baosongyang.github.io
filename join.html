<h4>General</h4>

My formal training is in computer science, but 
the interests of <a href="collaborators.html">my research group</a> are broad, 
and I can advise on many problems in multilingual NLP, from theoretical
to empirical. I prefer to do basic research in areas where the general 
principles are not yet fully understood, in order to improve the foundations 
of the field. The best work in this area is interdisciplinary, and I expect 
my collaborators to have a genuine interest in mathematics, statistics, 
computer science, and linguistics. You needn't be an expert in all of these 
areas (few people are), but you must be willing to engage with all of them, 
and with a diverse group of other people whose expertise differs from yours. 
If you aren't, my research group is not a good fit for you.

<h4>Prospective PhD students</h4>

<b>I expect to take one or (maybe) two new PhD students in 2016</b>, and I'm happy to 
discuss topics. I'm especially interested in these areas:

<dl>
<dt>Multilingual semantics</dt>
<dd>Natural language processing has been enormously successful, but NLP 
systems still often fail to preserve the semantics of sentences&mdash;the 
"who did what to whom" relationships that they express. As a result, they 
fail to correctly understand, translate, extract, or generate the meaning 
of a wide variety of phenomena in many languages. To preserve semantics, 
they must model semantics. Computational linguists have developed 
expressive mathematical models of language that exhibit high empirical 
coverage of semantically annotated linguistic data, correctly predict a 
variety of important linguistic phenomena in many languages, and can be 
processed with highly efficient algorithms. However, these models are not 
fully understood, and they are untested as the basis of statistical 
translation models. The goal of projects in this area is to develop the 
mathematics of semantic models and to apply them to basic problems in 
natural language understanding and generation.</dd>

<dt>Graph grammers, automata, and transducers for statistical semantics</dt>
<dd>We now have large quantities of sentences annotated with their semantics, 
in the form of directed graphs expressing "who did what to whom" 
relationships. This creates the possibility to learn large-scale statistical 
models of semantic parsing or text generation. From a machine learning 
perspective, this is a structured prediction problem: the input and outputs 
are strings, trees, or graphs. The formal machinery of structured prediction 
models  for strings and trees is often based on weighted automata and 
transducers: extensions of classical automata and transducers with 
real-valued weights representing probabilities. To extend these models to 
graph-based representations, we require automata and transducers for 
graphs, but these types of automata are much less well-developed than 
automata on strings and trees. The goal of projects in this area is to
extend the mathematics of weighted graph automata and transducers and to 
apply them to real data.</dd>

<dt>Massively parallel algorithms for language</dt>
<dd>Many classical algorithms and models in NLP assume sequential 
computation, an assumption broken by the trend of placing many cores on the 
same die. There are now multiple solutions to utilizing the transistor 
budget: a small number of complex cores, or a large number of simple cores.
The latter approach, exemplified by graphics processing units (GPUs) with 
thousands of parallel threads of execution, is especially tantalizing for 
computation-bound NLP problems. But harnessing the power of such processors 
requires a complete rethinking of the fundamental algorithms in the field. 
Projects in this area focus on the design of new algorithms and data 
structures for difficult problems in NLP&mdash;such as language understanding 
and generation&mdash;with the goal of achieving vast improvements in speed, 
and leading to new applications.</dd>

<dt>Low-resource language and speech processing</dt>
<dd>The most effective language and speech processing systems are based on 
statistical models learned from many annotated examples, a classic 
application of machine learning on input/ output pairs. But for many 
languages and domains we have little data. Even in cases where we do have 
data, it is government or news text. For the vast majority of languages and 
domains, there is hardly anything. However, in many cases, there is side 
information that we can exploit: dictionaries or other knowledge sources, 
or text paired with weak signals, such as images, speech, or timestamps. 
How can we exploit such heterogeneous information in statistical language 
processing? The goal of projects in this area is to develop statistical 
models and inference techniques that exploit such data, and apply them to 
real problems.</dd>

If any of these sound interesting to you, here is some more general advice 
about the application process:

Faculty in Edinburgh do not admit students directly. To be considered, you 
must apply for postgraduate study in the School of Informatics. I can advise 
students in three different programs:

<ol>
<li>PhD students in the <a href="http://www.ilcc.inf.ed.ac.uk/">Institute for Language, Cognition, and Computation</a>. This is a three-year research-only program.</li>
<li>MSc + PhD students in the <a href="http://datascience.inf.ed.ac.uk/">Center for Doctoral Training in Data Science</a>. This is a one-year MSc including coursework and research, followed by a three-year research-only PhD.</li>
<li>MSC + PhD students in the <a href="http://pervasiveparallelism.inf.ed.ac.uk/">Center for Doctoral Training in Pervasive Parallelismi</a>. This is a one-year MSc including coursework and research, followed by a three-year research-only PhD.</li>
</ol>

If you already have an MSc from a strong program, you may be a good candidate 
for the ILCC PhD. Consider one of the latter two programs if it is in a 
technical area that you would like to learn in more depth before beginning 
full-time research. You can apply to multiple programs concurrently.

For a September 2016 start, you should apply by December 11. That is not a 
hard deadline, but after that date, chances of admission diminish rapidly as 
funding is allocated to those who applied earlier. I'm happy to advise stong 
students on a research statement covering any topic of mutual interest, but 
<b>I cannot advise you on your chances of admission</b>, since that depends on 
many variables outside my control.

<h4>Current students in Edinburgh</h4>

If you're interested in working with me and you are a current student in 
one of the CDTs; an MSc, MInf, or undergraduate honours student; or a 
currently enrolled visiting student, then please get in touch! 

<h4>Prospective interns and visitors</h4>

<b>I do not currently have any openings for internships.</b> It's possible
that I may have internship openings in the future. If I do, they will be
listed here. If there's no listing, please do not send me an
unsolicited application. 

<p><b>I am unlikely host visiting scholars who I do not know personally.</b>

If you are a visitor who is already at the University I am 
happy to talk about research. 

<h4>Prospective Postdocs</h4>

<b>I do not currently have any openings for postdocs.</b>
