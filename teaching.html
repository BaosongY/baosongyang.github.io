  <h3>Teaching</h3>
  <blockquote><i>The subject of the lecture was beyond my competence. After the 
    first five minutes I was completely lost. At the end of the lecture an arcane 
    dialogue took place between the speaker and some members of the audience&mdash;Ambrose 
    and Singer if I remember correctly. There followed a period of tense silence. 
    Professor Struik broke the ice. He raised his hand and said, ``Give us something 
    to take home!'' Calabi obliged, and in the next five minutes he explained in 
    beautiful simple terms the gist of his lecture. Everybody filed out with a 
    feeling of satisfaction.</i><br/>&mdash;Gian-Carlo Rota</blockquote>

<h4>Other Teaching Material</h4>
<p>I have taught extensively on machine translation, giving tutorial
  lectures and invited short courses at many summer schools in
  North America and Europe. Over time I developed a substantial amount
  of teaching material. Many people have reused this material, often 
  improving it. You are welcome to reuse or study from it as well.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>I wrote a <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~alopez/papers/survey.pdf">survey paper</a>
    on statistical machine translation that appeared in ACM Computing Surveys in 2008. It
    gives a comprehensive overview of the field, aimed at first-year graduate students. 
    Although much has happened since it was published, most of the concepts in it
    remain vital, and the paper is widely cited.
  </li>
  <li>I taught a <a href="http://mt-class.org">graduate course</a> on machine translation.
    The course page contains all of my lectures, which include the
    material from my short courses and much more. They are
    freely reusable under a Creative Commons license.
  </li>
  <li>I developed a set of <a href="http://alopez.github.io/dreamt">open-ended challenge problems</a>
    for students learning about machine translation. They are simple, self-contained, and concise.
    Get the code on <a href="https://github.com/alopez/dreamt">github</a>. Within minutes you can experiment with basic algorithms
    of statistical machine translation, hone your knowledge of textbook algorithms by 
    implementing them, or prototype new algorithms and evaluate them. Try it out!
  </li>
  <li>I once gave <a href="http://videolectures.net/clspss09_lopez_mt/">a tutorial lecture</a>
    that was recorded.
