I was trained as a computer scientist, but my
[research group](/collaborators/) has diverse interests 
in natural language processing, and we work on many problems in 
this area, from theoretical to empirical. We tend to focus on basic 
curiosity-driven research in areas that aren't yet well understood, in 
order to improve the foundations of the field. We view NLP as an
interdisciplinary field, and to do interdisciplinary research, you need a 
discipline. So I look for collaborators from mathematics, machine learning,
computer science, and linguistics. I don't expect you to be an expert in 
all of these fields---few people are---but I do expect you to learn 
something about all of them from a diverse of group of collaborators.

## Prospective PhD students

I take one or two new PhD students each year. To apply, you must write
a research statement. I am happy to discuss this with keen
students, but I expect you to have done some [reading](/papers/) and thinking first in
an area of mutual interest, and I expect you to start the discussion with
some specific questions and ideas. If you have no questions or only a vague
idea about what you want to do, then I will simply refer you back to this 
page. I don't do this to discourage you and it doesn't mean you shouldn't 
apply! But it does mean that I can't help you at this stage and you'll need 
to do some more thinking about your own interests first. Here is what I'm 
currently interested in:

Natural language understanding systems confront a menagerie of complex and 
subtle phenomena. Deep learning is a useful tool in building these 
systems, but itâ€™s only one tool among many, and we don't fully 
understand its power or its flaws. Projects in this area aim to improve our 
understanding; here are some examples:

* Deep learning researchers claim that their models learn to represent 
linguistic properties of language without any explicit guidance. But recent 
results hint that they are simply very good at memorizing local 
correlations. **What do deep models really learn about language?** 

* For a system to understand a text and answer questions about it, the 
system must distill the meaning of the text into a set of facts (semantic 
parsing). We can represent these facts as a graph: entities and events 
become nodes, and relationships between them become edges. We now have 
datasets that pair text with such graphs, and we'd like to learn a semantic 
parser from this data, so we need to model graphs.**How do
we design and use deep probabilistic models of graphs?**

I'm also interested in many other things involving language, structure, and 
learning. To get a sense of what some of those things are, you can 
[read some of my recent papers](/papers/). I am happy to 
discuss specific questions or ideas related to my published work. 

If you're excited about natural language, but not these topics, you may
want to contact other members of 
[EdinburghNLP](http://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/index.php/people/)
or browse [PhD topics](http://www.ilcc.inf.ed.ac.uk/study/possible-phd-topics-in-ilcc)
they have proposed.
If you aren't genuinely interested in language, then my research group is 
not a good fit for you, and you should contact a different
supervisor in the 
[School of Informatics](http://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/).

If you're excited about all of this, I encourage you to apply for a PhD.
I advise students in two different programs:

* PhD students in the [Institute for Language, Cognition, and Computation](http://www.ilcc.inf.ed.ac.uk/). This is a three-year research-only program. [Read the application guidance](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc/study-with-us).
* PhD students in [Centres for Doctoral Training](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/postgraduate/cdts). These are four-year programs combining research and some formal taught elements. Multiple relevant CDTs are currently under review for funding, and the results will be announced in late 2018, in time to apply for a September 2019 start. If you'd like to be informed when this happens, [please follow the guidance at the top of this page](http://datascience.inf.ed.ac.uk/apply/).

**You cannot apply by emailing your documents to me.** You must use
the university's common application system, which you can find in the
application guidance links above.

If you already have an MSc in a relevant area, you can apply for the ILCC PhD. 
If you do not have an MSc, or if you'd like a longer programme with some
formal taught work, apply for one of the CDT programmes.
You can apply to multiple programmes concurrently. (But please only apply to
programmes that you are _genuinely interested in_. Applicants who submit
to many unrelated programmes across schools and colleges are usually rejected
because their interests are unclear.) Read more about the application process
[here](http://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/postgraduate/apply)

**I only review applications in winter admissions cycle.
For a September start, apply by the second week of December in
the preceding year.** That is not a 
hard deadline, but applying by then ensures that the school will 
consider you for funding, which is crucial since we only make funded offers
(unless you have a full outside scholarship).  **I 
cannot advise you on your chances of admission**, which depend on factors 
outside my control.

## Prospective MSc, MScR, or MPhil students

In brief: do not contact me if you are applying for one of these degrees,
because I have no influence over who is admitted or whether they will work 
with me.

Longer explanation: Taught MSc programmes in Edinburgh are very intensive 
and you will not have time on the side to join a research project. A third 
of the overall credits for the MSc come from an individual project, 
supervised by a member of staff, and you will need to devote all of your 
effort to your project. Projects are assigned early in semester 2, and
though the assignment considers your preferences, there is no guarantee that
you will get your preferred project due to the very large numbers of
students. Because of all the uncertainties around this process, I can make 
no guarantee that you will be able to work with me if you join our taught 
MSc programme. As a practical matter, MSc admissions are handled centrally
and I have no influence over them.

Our department rarely admit students directly to an MPhil or MScR degree, 
except as part
of a [1+3 CDT programme](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/postgraduate/cdts). 

## Self-funded students

If you have full funding from a fellowship that will pay for your tuition
and a living stipend, that's great! The purpose of your fellowship is to
enable you to pursue your intellectual interests, and if we have interests
in common, I'm happy to discuss them with you. Having a fellowship makes
admissions easier because it isn't contingent on funding, but it is still
crucial that we have mutual research interests. 

I do not take self-funded PhD students who pay out of their own pockets. This
would be unethical on at least two counts: (1) it gives unequal access; and 
(2) the university benefits from the labor of PhD students through their 
research and publications, and PhD students should be paid for this.

Practically, this means that we only offer admission to students we can
fund, or who are able to obtain a fellowship. I am acutely aware that this 
means that I can't work with many good applicants, but I will not make 
exceptions. 

## Current students in Edinburgh

If you're interested in working with me and you are a current student in 
one of the CDTs; an MSc, MInf, or undergraduate honours student; or a 
currently enrolled visiting student, then please get in touch! 

## Prospective interns and visitors

**I do not currently have any openings for internships.** When I do, 
I will list them here. Please do not send me an unsolicited application. 

**I will not host visiting scholars who I do not know personally.**

If you are already visiting the university I am happy to talk about research. 

## Prospective Postdocs

**I do not currently have any openings for postdocs.**
