<p>A course at <a href="http://nasslli2012.com/">NASSLLI 2012</a> taught by <a href="index.html">Adam Lopez</a>.  

<p> Google translate can instantly translate between any pair of over fifty human 
languages (for instance, from French to English). How does it do that? Why does 
it make the errors that it does? And how can you build something better? Modern 
translation systems <i>learn</i> how to translate by reading millions of words of 
already translated text, and this course will show you how they work. Despite
demonstrable success over the last decade, much work remains to be done, so
we will also identify open questions at the heart of current research, as well
as computational and linguistic insights that may help solve them. The 
course covers a diverse set of fundamental building blocks from linguistics, 
machine learning, algorithms, data structures, and formal language theory, 
along with their application to a real and difficult problem in artificial 
intelligence.

Introductory material on machine translation:
	<li><a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~alopez/papers/survey.pdf">Statistical Machine Translation</a> by <a href="index.html">Adam Lopez</a>. This is a forty-page self-contained survey of the field of statistical machine translation that was published in ACM Computing Surveys.  Much of the course material is based on the survey, and you can find more formal explanations of many of the course concepts there.</li>
	<li>For even more detail, <a href="http://www.statmt.org/book/">Statistical Machine Translation</a> is an introductory textbook written by <a href="http://www.iccs.informatics.ed.ac.uk/~pkoehn/">Philipp Koehn</a>.  Anyone with a serious interest in machine translation should have a copy of it.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.isi.edu/natural-language/mt/wkbk.pdf">A Statistical MT Tutorial Workbook</a> by <a href="http://www.isi.edu/~knight/">Kevin Knight</a> is a great, informal introduction for beginners.  You might consider working through this exercise before moving on to the above texts.
	<li><a href="http://www.iccs.informatics.ed.ac.uk/~pkoehn/">Philipp Koehn</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ccb/">Chris Callison-Burch</a> previously taught machine translation at ESSLLI in 2005: Day

  <li><a href="http://www.statmt.org">statmt.org</a> is a website with pointers to various statistical machine translation resources.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://mt-archive.info/">MT Archive</a> holds many, if not most, modern research papers on machine translation.</li>
  <li>On the non-technical side, <a href="http://www.hutchinsweb.me.uk/">John Hutchins</a> has written several interesting <a href="http://www.hutchinsweb.me.uk/main.htm">papers</a> about the history of machine translation and its uses.</li>
</ul>
There are many relevant tutorials on the fundamental techniques at the heart
of most statistical machine translation systems.  Here are few that I've
found useful.
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~mohri">Mehryar Mohri</a>'s 
    <a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/pub/cl1.pdf"a>tutorial</a> on weighted
    finite-state automata, which underlie many translation models.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.isi.edu/~chiang/">David Chiang</a>'s gentle <a href="http://www.isi.edu/~chiang/papers/synchtut.pdf">tutorial</a> on synchronous grammars, which underlie many other models (<a href="http://www.isi.edu/~chiang/papers/synchtut-slides.pdf">slides</a>).  I used a few of his examples in my slides.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.isi.edu/~lhuang/">Liang Huang</a>'s <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~lhuang3/coling.pdf">tutorial</a> on dynamic programming.
  <li><a href="http://ssli.ee.washington.edu/~bilmes/pgs/index.html">Jeff Bilmes</a> wrote a nice <a href="http://ssli.ee.washington.edu/~bilmes/mypubs/bilmes1997-em.pdf">tutorial</a> on the Expectation Maximization algorithm.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Software</h2>
State-of-the-art translation algorithms are implemented in a number of
open-source projects. The most popular of these are listed below.
They are all actively maintained and have significant userbases.

  <li><a href="http://www.statmt.org/moses/">Moses</a>: a widely-used toolkit implementing most major translation algorithms (C++).</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.cdec-decoder.org">cdec</a>: a fast decoder for a variety of translation models (C++).</li>
  <li><a href="http://kheafield.com/code/kenlm/">KenLM</a>: a fast language-modeling toolkit, can be used with the above systems (C++).</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/">SRI-LM</a>: a widely-used language modeling toolkit with many features, used with the above systems (C++).</li>

</ul>

<h2>Data</h2>
Modern machine translation systems work by learning from large amounts
of data. Many datasets are freely available. By feeding one of these
datasets into one of the software toolkits above, you can build your 
own a machine translation in as little as a few hours or days.
